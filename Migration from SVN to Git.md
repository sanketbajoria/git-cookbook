# Migration from SVN to Git
## 1) Install Ruby

Yep, Ruby. Go get it from  [the Ruby Installer for Windows](http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/)  page and install the latest version with all the defaults – except this one:

Get the Ruby executable added to your PATH environment variable so that you can run it from anywhere (more on why soon). You’ll probably need a reboot for that PATH declaration to kick in too.

## 2) Install git
Download git from https://git-scm.com/download/win and install it.

## 3) Install svn2git
gem install svn2git
